Name	 :- aligned_malloc
Arguments:- number of bytes & Alignment Boundry
Return :- NULL on error
valid pointer on success
Working	:- It will allocate memory with starting address 
multiple of alignment passed and returns pointer 
to it on success.
Ex. 
aligned_malloc(50,128);
This will allocate 50 bytes of memory with
starting address multiple of 128.

/* We need to use malloc provided by C. First we need to allocate memory
of size bytes + alignment + sizeof(size_t) . We need 'bytes' because 
user requested it. We need to add 'alignment' because malloc can give us 
any address and we need to find multiple of 'alignment', so at maximum multiple
of alignment will be 'alignment' bytes away from any location. We need 
'sizeof(size_t)' for implementing 'aligned_free', since we are returning modified 
memory pointer, not given by malloc ,to the user, we must free the memory 
allocated by malloc not anything else. So I am storing address given by malloc just above 
pointer returning to user. Thats why I need extra space to store that address. 
Then I am checking for error returned by malloc, if it returns NULL then 
aligned_malloc will fail and return NULL.
