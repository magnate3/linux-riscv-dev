# ACC-Turbo

This repository contains the code used in [ACC-Turbo](https://nsg.ee.ethz.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/sigcomm22-final615.pdf), which will be presented at [SIGCOMM'22](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2022/).

## What can I find in this repo?

* `simulations` contains the code of all the experiments for **Section 2 (Background)** and **Section 8 (Simulation-based Evaluation)** of the paper. It includes an implementation of ACC-Turbo on Python and the experiments on [NetBench](https://github.com/ndal-eth/netbench).

* `tofino` contains the code of all the experiments for **Section 7 (Hardware-based Evaluation)** of the paper. It includes the code to run ACC-Turbo on programmable switches (both the P4 code and the Python-based controller), and the code required to generate and receive the traffic from each of the servers. It also includes the code to process the results and generate the plots in the paper.

* `paper.pdf` contains the latest version of the paper.

**ðŸš€ Quick start:** Check the `README.md` files on the `simulations` and `tofino` folders to find out how to reproduce all the software-based, and hardware-based experiments of the paper, respectively.
