# Applications

In this directory, there are several applications that can be used throughout this course project.


## Traffic generator

The traffic generator is used to send traffic between different hosts in the Mininet.
Here is the instruction to run the traffic generator

```
sudo ./apps/send_traffic.py --trace ./apps/trace/XXX.trace --topo xx/topology.json
```

This command will replay the traffic defined the trace file. The trace file is generated by the **trace genrator**, which will be described later.

Note that this script requires `sudo` previledge. Without it the script will crash.
In case the script fails, please use the following command to guarantee that the script is killed completely.

```
sudo ./apps/kill_traffic.sh
```

To learn more about the traffic generator, please read [traffic_generator/README.md].

## Trace generator

The trace generator define the traffic to be played in the Mininet. There are two types of traffic that can be defined: `iperf` traffic and `memcached` traffic.
- The `iperf` traffic can be either `tcp` and `udp`, which transmits random data using the full bandwidth, with best effort.
- The `memcached` traffic contains small-sized read/write requests for key-value stores. The traffic contains small packets, one packet per request.

To learn more about how to use the trace generator, please read [trace/README.md].
