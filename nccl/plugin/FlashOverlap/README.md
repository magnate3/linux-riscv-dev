## How *FlashOverlap* Works
![FlashOverlap](./docs/_static/image/typical_timeline.jpeg)
The figure shows a typical timeline of computation-communication overlap in FlashOverlap. Two CUDA streams are for computation and communication, respectively. The CUTLASS kernel sends signals during GEMM computation in one stream, while a counting kernel stalls NCCL communication until receiving a preset number of signals in the other stream.

## Build and Install
### Dependency
The main dependency is [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl/nccl-download), which *FlashOverlap* uses for communication. It is convenient to download from the official website. The code has been tested with `v2.18.3` and `v2.19.3`. 

Another dependency is [CUTLASS](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass.git), which is included as submodule. Note that the code has been tested with `v3.6.0` and `v3.9.0`, but fails with `v3.4.0`. We assume `CUTLASS>=v3.6.0` works fine.  

The code only supports `sm_80, sm_86, sm_89` now, and the evaluation enviroments include NVIDIA RTX 3090, RTX 4090, A800, and A100 GPUs. The versions of CUDA Toolkit include `CUDA 12.1, 12.2`.

### Install
First, pull the repo:

```shell
    $ git clone https://github.com/infinigence/FlashOverlap.git
    $ cd FlashOverlap
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
```
Install PyTorch and other required packages through `pip` or `conda`:
```shell
    $ pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
    $ pip install numpy==2.1.2, pandas==2.2.3, setuptools==75.8.0
```

Before compiling, generate the GEMM instances:
```shell
    $ mkdir ./configs
    $ cd ./tool
    $ python generate_instances.py
```

This repo uses cmake (>=3.18) for compiling:

```shell
    $ cmake -B build
    $ cmake --build build -j
```
Then the operators are registered as torch.class, and in Python code, the `.so` should be included whenever the operators are used.
```python
    torch.ops.load_library("../build/lib/libst_pybinding.so")
```

## Quick Start
⚠️ ***Notice:*** the boundary handling is not implemented, thus the repo only supports regular GEMM shapes now (`M, N % 128 == 0`).

### Generate GEMM configuration
Currently the repo supports two ways to generate the proper configs for GEMMs for better performance. Only one GPU is needed for this operation. 

0. Make sure the `./configs` dir is created. 
```shell
    $ cd tune
```

1. Using the [CUTLASS Profiler](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass/blob/main/media/docs/cpp/profiler.md). Follow the README and write the profiling results in `$CSV_PATH/*.csv`. Then, generate the `.json` file in configs. 
```shell
    $ python gen_config.py --m $M --n $N --k $K --path $CSV_PATH
```

2. Using the customized profiler for a specific shape. The profiling process finishes within minutes. (This method has not been evaluated on RTX 4090 and RTX 3090 yet, will be updated soon.)
```shell
    $ python profile_config.py --m $M --n $N --k $K
```

### Tune
Tune the wave group size. Note multiple GPUs are needed in this program and the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` must be set, as we use the `spawn` method (torch.multiprocessing.spawn) and the rank and world size are explicitly determined. 

1. The repo provides both the exhaustive and predictive search methods, and the latter is recommended when `MxN>4096x4096`. If the predictive method is chosen, please generate the bandwidth curve first. Given GPU and communication primitive, the bandwidth curve needs only one generation. 
```shell
    $ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python bandwidth.py --comm_op all_reduce
```
2. Two search methods share the same script, `--predictive_search` should be specified if used.
```shell
    $ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python search.py --m $M --n $N --k $K --comm_op {all_reduce, reduce_scatter} --predictive_search True
```
3. The generated solution is written into the corresponding `.json` file. 

### Speed Test
Open the test dir and run the script.
```shell
    $ cd ./test
    $ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python test.py --m $M --n $N --k $K --comm_op {all_reduce, reduce_scatter}
```

### Correctness Test
1. Open the example dir.
```
    $ cd ./example
```

2. Evaluate the correctness of GEMM+AllReduce+RMSNorm. The RMSNorm must be included as the tile order is corrected in the kernel. 
```shell
    $ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python correctness_{ar, rs}.py --m $M --n $N --k $K
```
3. We define the `ReorderRMSNorm` class in `RMSNorm.py` and the `OverlapRowParallelLayer` class in `RowParallelLayer.py`, which can replace the `RMSNorm` class and `RowParallelLayer` class, respectively. It's a simple example of usage in end-to-end inference or training.
